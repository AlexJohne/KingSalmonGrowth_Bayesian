100S_feed_provided.csv --> contains amount of feed consumed daily at the tank level from around day 91, estimated tank biomass, number of fish, and 
estimated average tank weight for the 100 % satiation ration treatment (100S)

100_fish_growth.csv --> contains individual ID, wet weight, average tank wet weight, and, where available, individual intake data (again 100S only)


# Methods (data collection)
A single cohort of all-female king salmon juveniles were sourced from a local hatchery (Clearwater Hatchery, Mt Cook Alpine Salmon, Twizel, New Zealand), 
where the fish were individually implanted with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag (HID Global, EM4305 684,230, 12 mm glass tags). 
The growth trial was conducted over a period of 276 days in the Finfish Research Centre (FRC) at the Cawthron Aquaculture Park (CAP), New Zealand. 
After a 21-to-24-day acclimation period to tank conditions at 15°C, 1625 fish (average wet weight ± SD: 40.67 ± 8.13 g, wet weight range: 21.14g – 63.75 g) 
were randomly distributed between nine 8000 L circular freshwater tanks. The initial stocking was 176 to 187 fish per tank with a coefficient of variation 
for wet weight between 16% and 21%. Throughout the experiment, water temperature was maintained at 17 ± 0.5°C and photoperiod was set to 24 h continuous 
light to prevent early maturation. Water quality parameters, such as nitrogenous waste levels, turbidity, total suspended solids, oxygen and pH, were 
monitored daily and maintained within limits for salmonid aquaculture (Thorarensen & Farrell, 2011). 


Feeding regimes and sampling 
	
The experiment tested the effects of three feed rations – 60%, 80%, or 100% satiation (n=3) – on growth performance. One extruded feed with pellet sizes 
of 4 mm and 6 mm was used throughout the experiment (Tasman Freshwater experimental diet, Ridley, Australia). 
Fish were handfed one meal per day. Tank feed intake was measured daily – uneaten pellets were collected, counted, and subtracted from the weight of 
feed delivered. The 100% satiation ration was determined by hand feeding until apparent satiation, defined as the time when the feeding response of all 
individuals within a tank had ceased. The respective feed amounts for the 60% and 80% feed ration treatment groups were calculated using a feed model based 
on daily observations of feed amount consumed by the 100% satiation treatment group and adjusted for predicted average weight and tank biomass. 
For simplicity, the rations of 60%, 80% and 100% satiation will be referred to as treatments 60S, 80S, and 100S, respectively. Throughout the experiment, 
several fish were removed for laboratory analysis, for biomass reduction (total tank biomass was maintained below a maximum density of 25 kg/m3), 
and if they had failed to gain weight between two sampling events (only 1 fish was removed from the 80S treatment group for this reason). Additionally, 
a total of 12 other mortalities (overnight mortalities, jumpers, mortalities due to post-handling stress) were recorded. Feed amount was adjusted 
accordingly. Individuals were weighed repeatedly under anaesthesia (65 ppm tricaine methane sulfonate (Syndel, Canada)) on six occasions 
(days 0, 91, 124, 173, 221 and 276), individual daily feed intake (DFI) was quantified using the x-ray “ballotini” bead method (McCarthy et al., 1993; 
Talbot & Higgins, 1983; Walker et al., 2012) on four occasions (days 124, 173, 221 and 276). The “ballotini” beads were ceramic zirconium silicate type ZS 
(9305, 0.4 - 0.6mm) SiLibeads® supplied by Sigmund Lindner GmbH. Beads were added to the feed mash prior to extrusion, at an inclusion rate of 1%. X-ray 
images were obtained using an Atomscope HFX90V EX9025V portable X-ray Unit (DLC Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) and Canon CXDI 410C Wireless 
Cesium Amorphous Silicon digital radiographic receptor (DLC Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). The “ballotini” feed was fed based on tank ration 
and uneaten feed was recovered. Fish were anaesthetized and x-rayed to determine the total number of “ballotini” beads in the gastrointestinal tract. 
The x-ray images were processed using the proprietary batch processing “Bead Counter” software developed by AgResearch (P Smale, personal communication) 
and validated against manual counts (Walker et al., 2012). Wet weight and daily feed intake measurements were taken for all experimental fish.
